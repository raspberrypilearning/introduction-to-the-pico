## Introduction
This guide shows you how to connect a Raspberry Pi Pico to another computer and program it using the Pico Zero beginner library with MicroPython.

### What is the Raspberry Pi Pico?
A Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost microcontroller device. Microcontrollers are tiny computers, but they tend to lack large volume storage and peripheral devices that you can plug in (for example, keyboards or monitors).

A Raspberry Pi Pico has GPIO pins, much like a Raspberry Pi computer, which means it can be used to control and receive input from a variety of electronic devices.

### How to use this reference guide

If you have not used a Raspberry Pi Pico before, then this guide will help you to set up ready to complete the [Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro).

You can return to this guide and use it to look up information that you need when you are making your own projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico.
