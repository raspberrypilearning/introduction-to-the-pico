## RGB LEDs

RGB LEDs produce a range of colours by combining Red(R), Green(G) and Blue(B) light. 

RGB LEDs have 4 legs rather than two. Our projects **common cathode** RGB LEDs which means one leg needs connecting to a **GND** pin and the other three legs need connecting to **GPIO** pins.

There are also common anode RGBLEDs, which means that one leg needs connecting to a **3.3V** pin, and the other legs need connecting to **GPIO** pins.

With either type of RGB LED, a resistor is needed for each pin that is connected to a **GPIO** pin. The datasheet for an RGB LED will tell you the **forward current** and **forward voltage** for each colour on the LED, to help you calculate the resistor needed, although it is often easier just to use a fairly high value resistor on each of the legs, such as a 220Î©.

Here is how you could wire an RGB LED to a Raspberry Pi Pico.

Here is some code that you could use, to make the LED cycle through the colours.

while True:
