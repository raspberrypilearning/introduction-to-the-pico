## Install Thonny

In this step, you will install Thonny or make sure you have the latest version. Then you will connect to a Raspberry Pi Pico and run some simple Python code using the Shell. 

Note: If you are completing this project in a school or other setting with a managed network, then you should make sure that you have the appropriate permissions to mount a USB drive and install software.

You're now ready to move on to the next step and connect your Raspberry Pi Pico.
